## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character from the pastoral past interacts with a piece of Enlightenment-era technology, not with fear, but with a profound, misunderstood recognition.
- Create a journal entry from Claire's perspective as she uses her 'practical map' mind to catalog the tangible, everyday anomalies (sounds, smells, textures) of the overlapping timelines.
- Draft a folktale or song that the 'ghost' shepherds might tell about the strange, hard future they see layered over their fields.
- Imagine a confrontation between the Marquis de Launay and the ancient entity of the river itself, debating the nature of progress, duty, and time.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map that visualizes the village of Saint-Pardoux, allowing users to toggle between the 'Present' (Enlightenment), 'Past' (Pastoral), and 'Overlap' layers, with clickable landmarks revealing narrative fragments.
- Design a generative art system that uses a river metaphor: user-input text (themes, character names) 'flows' as a stream, and striking certain keywords (like 'machine', 'silence', 'apple') causes visual disruptions, overlaps, or reveals of a secondary, older pattern beneath.
