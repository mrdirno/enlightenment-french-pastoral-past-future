Turner, combined with the detailed ecological surrealism of Thomas Cole], [book cover framing, centered composition, dramatic angle: a wraparound book cover composition, centered on the figure's poignant action, viewed from a low-angle that emphasizes the imposing, fractured sky where past and future collide], [appropriate lighting style with color temperature: dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with a golden-hour glow piercing through storm clouds, casting long shadows, using a palette of desiccated umbers, cracked-sienna, and ashen grey contrasted with the spectral verdant greens and cerulean blues of the phantom past], masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
